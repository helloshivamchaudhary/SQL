Here's a roadmap for beginners to learn SQL (Structured Query Language)

1. **Understanding Databases**:
   - Learn what databases are and their importance in data management.
   - Explore different types of databases, such as relational databases (SQL) and NoSQL databases.

2. **SQL Basics**:
   - Start with the fundamental SQL commands:
     - `SELECT`: Retrieve data from a database table.
     - `INSERT`: Add new data to a table.
     - `UPDATE`: Modify existing data in a table.
     - `DELETE`: Remove data from a table.

3. **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**:
   - Learn about popular DBMS such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and SQLite.
   - Install and set up a DBMS of your choice on your local machine.

4. **Creating Tables**:
   - Learn how to create database tables to store structured data.
   - Define data types for columns (e.g., INTEGER, VARCHAR, DATE).
   - Understand primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.

5. **Data Manipulation**:
   - Practice using SQL statements to interact with data:
     - Retrieve data using `SELECT` with filtering and sorting.
     - Insert, update, and delete records.
     - Aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT).
     - Group data using `GROUP BY`.

6. **Data Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Use `WHERE` clause for data filtering.
   - Sort data using `ORDER BY`.
   - Perform text and numeric comparisons.

7. **Joins and Relationships**:
   - Learn about database relationships, such as one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.
   - Practice different types of joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN).

8. **Subqueries**:
   - Understand how to use subqueries within SQL statements.
   - Practice subqueries for advanced data retrieval.

9. **Database Design**:
   - Study principles of good database design (normalization, denormalization).
   - Learn about ER (Entity-Relationship) diagrams to plan database structures.

10. **Indexes and Performance**:
    - Explore indexing for optimizing query performance.
    - Understand the importance of database optimization.

11. **Transactions and ACID**:
    - Learn about database transactions and the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties.

12. **Stored Procedures and Functions**:
    - Create and use stored procedures and functions to encapsulate SQL logic.

13. **Views and Triggers**:
    - Understand how to create and use views for virtual tables.
    - Learn about triggers to automate actions in response to events.

14. **Security and Permissions**:
    - Explore database security by setting up user roles and permissions.
    - Understand best practices for securing your database.

15. **Advanced SQL Concepts**:
    - Dive into more advanced topics like window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and recursive queries.

16. **Practical Projects**:
    - Apply your SQL skills to real-world projects and scenarios.

17. **Online Courses and Tutorials**:
    - Enroll in online courses and tutorials to gain structured learning.

18. **Practice and Documentation**:
    - Continuously practice SQL through exercises and projects.
    - Keep a documentation of your SQL queries and solutions for reference.

19. **Community and Forums**:
    - Join SQL-related forums and communities to ask questions and learn from others.

20. **Keep Learning**:
    - SQL is a vast field, so keep learning and staying updated with new features and developments in the world of databases and SQL.
